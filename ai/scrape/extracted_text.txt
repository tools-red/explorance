This program is aimed at women leaders in India. 


You could be a:




A corporate director seeking to elevate skill-sets in a changing world.


A senior executive in a company or a professional services firm looking to fulfill board roles - whether currently serving, retiring, or retired.


An entrepreneur or a director or member of family-owned businesses.


A manager acting as director in multinational companies or unlisted subsidiaries.






Did You Know


As of March 31, 2023, there are nearly 7,500 companies (out of which 5,200 are listed) that need
                                            women directors on their boards. In addition, in 2024 and thereafter every year, a significant
                                            number of women directors would be finishing their term, which would present new opportunities
                                            for next-generation women leaders (Source: CMIE)






The Indian context


Even after a decade since the passage of the Companies Act 2013, which mandated at least
                                            one-woman director on company boards, in Nifty-500 companies an average of one in five board
                                            members is a woman (223 Nifty-500 companies have only one- woman director).


The Companies Act, 2013 mandated the following category of companies to appoint at least
                                            one-woman director:




Every listed company


Every other public company with either:
                                                
 - Paid-up share capital of INR 1 billion (approx. US$12 million) or more; or

                                                    - Turnover of INR 3 billion (approx. US$36.02 million) or more






The reform has the potential to create a sea of opportunities, both at individual and societal level.
                                            It opens a career path for qualified women who can take up board positions. The reform, when
                                            implemented in its true spirit, has the potential to making Indian society more inclusive and
                                            breaking gender barriers when it comes to decision making in the top echelons of one of the world’s
                                            most dynamic economies










Program Objectives


The program aims to provide women leaders with the skills and knowledge they need to
                                            successfully transition from executive positions to corporate board roles.


The program also offers women leaders on the Board a chance to enhance their skills and optimize
                                            their performance as directors.


This program will enable participants to




understand roles and responsibilities of corporate directors and board committees


match their skills and talents to the board’s specific needs


carry out board tasks and engage in collaborative decision-making


add value to an organization as overseers of its leadership and strategic direction


balance shareholder demands with those of other stakeholders in driving long-term
                                                performance


navigate the challenges and put laws and perspectives into practice


manage personal reputation as a board director and mitigate your own risks

The Centre of Excellence for Himalayan Studies


Opened in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences (SHSS), the Centre was formally launched in an event held on 24 January 2023




































About



                                The Centre of Excellence for Himalayan Studies                            












The Centre of Excellence for Himalayan Studies under the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence (SNIoE) is a research centre focussed on the economy, borders and identities, the environment and regional geopolitics of the wider Himalayan region including the Hindu Kush and the Karakoram.  While there are scholars of the Himalayas and small centres and research groups focused on the region, there is a need for institutionalised efforts at the national level that brings together a wide variety of disciplinary and sectoral approaches to the study of what is one of the world’s most environmentally sensitive and politically fraught regions and one that simultaneously has a significant influence on the economic livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people. At the same time, it is difficult to ignore the role of geopolitics in this region.

About








































The Centre of Excellence for Himalayan Studies under the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence (SNIoE) is a research centre focussed on the economy, borders and identities, the environment and regional geopolitics of the wider Himalayan region including the Hindu Kush and the Karakoram.  While there are scholars of the Himalayas and small centres and research groups focused on the region, there is a need for institutionalised efforts at the national level that brings together a wide variety of disciplinary and sectoral approaches to the study of what is one of the world’s most environmentally sensitive and politically fraught regions and one that simultaneously has a significant influence on the economic livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people. At the same time, it is difficult to ignore the role of geopolitics in this region.


Therefore, even as the Centre pushes for an approach to studying the Himalayas that crosses both national and disciplinary boundaries as well as engenders a three-way conversation between central and local governments, academia and the people who live in the region, it also remains sharply aware of and is attuned to geopolitics and the policy imperatives that surround it.


The Centre reflects SNIoE’s global outlook and ambitions, focusing on engaging researchers with niche or specialised interest in the wider Himalayas, and identifying and creating a network of scholars in the field, both in India and externally, to support its work. This critical mass of scholars of and from the region will redress the longstanding neglect or asymmetrical representation of the Himalayas and beyond, in knowledge, discourse and policy interventions. It also aims to develop and utilise strong links with the policy community and government agencies in a mutually supportive exercise.


The Centre also signifies a leadership role for the SNIoE, as it attempts to fill gaps in both academic and policy spaces. This leadership role is in keeping with the University’s identity and goals of promoting innovation, creativity and inter-disciplinary engagement in the field of Indian education. The Centre also offers the SNIoE’s own faculty and students opportunities to collaborate with counterparts from across the wider Himalayan region as well as those working on the region from elsewhere in the world.

Abstract: Xi Jinping became President of PRC in the year 2013 and immediately began to roll out his vision of a China-led/China-centric world order. The announcement of the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI) and its insertion into the Constitution and ideological framework of the Communist Party of China, was accompanied by a proclamation of the realization of the Chinese Dream in the 21st century. Under Xi Jinping, China has continued to champion the process of economic globalization for the world, even as it has also gone about clipping the wings of big private players in its economy. Post-COVID-19, President Xi Jinping decided to go beyond the realm of trade and economics in terms of China’s role in shaping the world order. His announcement of three global initiatives - developmental, security and civilizational - accompanied by a declaration of a vision of Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind, can be considered as the most serious effort by China in the post-Mao era to claim a leadership role in the world. It is aimed at convincing the majority of the countries in the world that it is eminently feasible to have a harmonious existence with China as a global power. Xi Jinping is trying to portray a multi-civilization world order led by China, in contrast to the incumbent rules-based order, created and led by the Western countries, particularly the United States. It is imperative to examine the contours of Xi Jinping’s worldview as it has evolved over the past decade and its implications for the world order.

Students Testimonials


















I realised that age doesn’t matter in learning and also that we don’t make an earnest effort to know the things around us. All it needs is a little focus. It is these small things around us that go unnoticed which constitute the essential elements to make our life happier, it creates a deep bond of love.


Mahi Garg 
DPS World School
























I had come here with an open mind. What I loved was observing the different bird species, their habitat, and their calls. It was a special experience to observe the Indian white-eye. I always knew birds are afraid of humans by the Starlings were a real surprise, they came very close to us and weren't afraid. It was at bio-diversity park on the campus that I saw for the first time a tree that had patterns like snowflakes.


Priyanshi Garg 
Grade 11 student
























Besides what I learned through activities, it was memorable to be with so many people in a beautiful place. My interaction with friends, faculty, and staff taught me so many new things. Everyone was so inspiring, friendly, and knowledgeable. Everyone in the programme was so curious.

Academics


The undergraduate curriculum at Shiv Nadar enables students to pursue a Major and take multiple electives from across disciplines. This freedom to design unique pathways helps bring out the best in every student and enables them to develop capabilities that are important for their success. The result is an empowered, intellectually self-confident citizen with an enhanced capacity for thinking through complexity, problem-solving, collaboration, creativity, and innovation.
































 




 Multidisciplinary Curriculum


The multidisciplinary curriculum is one central pillar of the education we offer. Students acquire expertise in a domain (their Major) but simultaneously are required to take a wide range of courses outside their Major.

 Focus on Research and Innovation


At Shiv Nadar, our mission is to foster an interest in research from the undergraduate level. The Opportunities for Undergraduate Research (OUR) program enables students to undertake research projects with faculty members in any discipline.

 Office of Dean of Academics


The Office of the Dean of Academics has the responsibility for developing and implementing the academic and administrative policies about the programs and students of the University, in accordance with the University's mission to "help students acquire and develop knowledge, skills, and leadership qualities relevant in the 21st Century and beyond.

Multidisciplinary Curriculum


The multidisciplinary curriculum is one central pillar of the education we offer. Students acquire expertise in a domain (their Major), but at the same time are required to take a wide range of courses outside their Major. The University’s undergraduate program provides students with the flexibility to pursue Major-Minor combinations as well. For example, Shrey Jain, recognized as a '30 under 30' by Forbes Asia, combined his Major in Electrical and Communication Engineering with a Minor in History.


Common Core Curriculum (CCC)




At least 18 credits.


The CCC is designed to provide students an understanding of the forces that are driving local, national, and global changes and to give them an awareness of the problems facing an increasingly integrated world.




Major




At least 108 credits.


All undergraduate students must specialize in a Major, ensuring that upon the completion of their degree they will be prepared to step into the working world or continue on to postgraduate studies with a high level of expertise in their subject, and with the competence to meet the highest standards of employers or postgraduate faculties.




University-Wide Electives




At least 18 credits.


The students have the flexibility to choose multiple university-wide electives, which provide them the opportunity to discover their academic passion and enhance their engagement in the learning process through the individualization of their programs of study.




























Focus on Research and Innovation


At Shiv Nadar, our mission is to foster a love for research right from the undergraduate level. The 
Opportunities for Undergraduate Research (OUR)
 program enables undergraduate students to undertake research projects with faculty members in any discipline. Many undergraduate students have published their research work through this initiative.


Innovation and entrepreneurship are key pillars of the Shiv Nadar ecosystem. The Atal Incubation Center (AIC) was established in 2017 in our campus with the support of the Atal Incubation Mission of Niti Aayog. The objective of this mission was to foster the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship nationwide. The AIC is equipped with world-class facilities and state-of-the-art infrastructure spread over 10,000 sq. ft.


The Bachelor of Management Studies (BMS) program has entrepreneurial education built into their core curriculum. The Business Practicum and the Venture Challenge offer students unique opportunities for launching their own ventures while studying.

About Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence
























The Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence is a multidisciplinary, student-centric research university established in 2011 by Shiv Nadar, one of India’s foremost philanthropists and a pioneer of technological revolution. It has four Schools, viz., Engineering, Natural Sciences, Humanities and Social Sciences, Management & Entrepreneurship, and the Academy of Continuing Education. We were the first university in the country to offer a 4-year multidisciplinary research degree. Today, we are continuing as trailblazers with new kinds of curriculum, championed by faculty drawn from some of the top institutions in the country and the world. With low faculty-student ratios, their in-depth attention to students lead to high levels of student success.


At Shiv Nadar, academic research is the fundamental building block of the academic mission. It includes basic and applied research, scholarly publications and creative expression, and interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research. The University is home to excellent research infrastructure including a dedicated Research Block with an area of 63000 sq.ft. that houses major research equipments and facilities for experimental research. The University is the first in the country to establish a Center for Genomics and Spatial Transcriptomics (STOMICS). The library, housed in an iconic building, is also a central part of our campus.

We live in a deeply interconnected world with a wide-variety of devices and channels supporting unprecedented exchanges of ideas and information. Managers must cope with rapid change in a volatile and complex global business environment in which seemingly distant global events affect company strategies and policies at the other end of the world. This requires analytical and cognitive capabilities of a new order as well as deep 'action' learning that is very distinct from the programs offered by traditional B-Schools.

ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT


Our Departments




The School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Shiv Nadar University has a distinctive identity with seven diverse departments which are unified by the common themes of sustainability, data, and the local context.
 
























School of Humanities and Social Sciences


 Department of Sociology






The Department of Sociology is committed to fostering critical awareness and a nuanced understanding of contemporary society. We encourage our students to think deeply about what it means to inhabit the world with others, and how these relations affect our selves.  
 




Learn More




























School of Humanities and Social Sciences


Department of Design






Department of Design nurtures creative minds into outstanding design leaders with a passion for creating a difference in society. It is grounded in the philosophy of liberal education and intends to offer programs that provide students with holistic transdisciplinary education along with specialization in their specific areas of interest.
 




Learn More




























School of Humanities and Social Sciences


 Department of Art, Media, and Performance






The Department of Art, Media and Performance (AMP) offers a wide array of innovative interdisciplinary programs fostering a critical and rigorous approach to contemporary art, media, dance, and research.


 




Learn More




























School of Humanities and Social Sciences


Department of Economics






The department offers excellent training in Economics which is comparable to internationally acclaimed programs, and students are encouraged to be creative, analytical, and logical thinkers. This way of thinking enables them to offer innovative solutions to the problems they face in their surroundings.  
 




Learn More




























School of Humanities and Social Sciences


Department of English






As a department, we combine intellectual rigor with continuous innovation inside and outside the classroom. To that end, we offer a wide range of undergraduate and graduate courses. Our excellent student-teacher ratio enables us to particularly pay close attention to how our students write—to help them approach both academic and creative writing with critical rigor and imaginative reach, and to address specialist as well as general audiences effectively.
 




Learn More




























School of Humanities and Social Sciences


 Department of History and Archaeology






We impart rigorous training in the methods and theoretical approaches in both history and archaeology from the undergraduate level and encourage students to think and write creatively. We feel the real challenge in teaching archaeology and history is to introduce students to the past in its totality, since both disciplines are concerned with vast sweeps of time and space.
 




Learn More




























School of Humanities and Social Sciences


Department of International Studies and Governance Studies






The department combines a strong interest in bringing world historical developments in conversation with international relations theorizing. While conscious of developments in the Anglo-American mainstream, the department is inclined to pursue genuinely wide-ranging empirical and theoretically anchored accounts of international politics across diverse issue areas – development, security, and the environment.

Research


Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence is a research university, in that, academic research in its broadest meaning including basic and applied research, scholarly publications, and creative expression, are the fundamental building blocks of the academic mission of the University. We believe strongly in the role of the University as a center for the discovery and creation of new forms of knowledge and expression, and in a mission to contribute to the process of creating knowledge, not just disseminating it. The University’s goal is to become nationally and internationally recognized for the quality of our research and creative endeavors, and their applicability to improving quality of life, generating new insights, and expanding the boundaries of human knowledge and creativity.


































 




 University-wide Research Priorities


In 2021, we undertook an extensive exercise which we called 'Quo Vadis'. Four priority researches were identified by the university community: Environment, Energy, Cognition and behavior, and Data and computation.


















 




 Research Excellence Initiatives


The University offers help in various funding vistas in India and abroad. It also provides startup grants, core research grants, and fellowships across disciplines.

 Research resources and compliance


Strong emphasis on interdisciplinary research that cuts across academic programs has allowed the University to break disciplinary silos and institute a broad-based pedagogical structure. The synergy between teaching and research is the stronghold, rooted in the belief and efforts towards creation of knowledge (by researching) and not just disseminating it (by teaching).

A message


From the Dean's Desk




















Dr. Suneet Tuli

Dean, Research & Partnerships


Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence 


B.E. (Honors), Electrical & Electronics, BITS Pilani

M.Tech., Electronics, IIT Delhi

Ph.D., Electronics, IIT Delhi


“Research, with its many facets, is the driver of vibrant human progress. At the Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, our vision is to create new knowledge and undertake creative expressions of the human spirit. Though we are a 
multidisciplinary research-focused university, 
academically organised around four distinct schools, we also 
lay strong emphasis on interdisciplinarity for quality research.
”
































Active and meaningful collaborations are the keys to research successes in today's strongly connected world. At SNIoE, 
a combined Research and Partnerships in one office, underlines the importance we place on collaborations as a key enabler
. These could be academic, industrial, societal, national, and/or international. The Research and Partnerships office also lays great emphasis on promoting collaborations within the University.

 


Stepping into our second decade, recognized as an Institution of Eminence, we have held university-wide discussions to collectively identify the focus of future research. This has resulted in the emergence of common research themes across all Schools. 




Environment


Cognition & Behavior


Data & Computation and


Energy




Other identified interschool themes for engagement include Materials, Computational Science and Engineering, Biology, Emerging Economies, Entrepreneurial Leadership, Digital Transformation, Analytics, and Organizational Performance. 


There exists a strong supporting ecosystem, including state-of-the-art laboratory spaces, post-doctoral fellows and research scholars, research promotion through start-up/seed funds, professional development assistance, consumable grants, fellowships to research scholars, travel support, etc. Around 30 MoUs with reputed institutions of the world provide for meaningful collaborations and building relationships to enhance research capabilities. Many new schemes are being continuously introduced to facilitate faculty in their research pursuits. 


As Dean, I welcome and encourage our existing and prospective students and faculty, to explore the research avenues available at the Shiv Nadar IoE. 


































Research Highlights






Since its inception, the University has received close to 54 crore Rupees in extramural funding from 154 ongoing and completed research grants. We have received research funding from different agencies such as the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) etc. As per SCOPUS, to date, the University has produced 2438 research publications with a total of 27325 citations. The University has been granted 3 patents and has 34 patents either filed or published. In addition, the University has 8 trademarks registered under its name.

Two dimensional materials for device applications


Two-dimensional materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) such as MoS2, WSe2, MoSe2, MoTe2, etc have emerged as brand new photonic materials due to their unique properties and multiple functions. TMDS's are atomically thin semiconductors of the type MX2 with a transition metal (M) atom and a chalcogen (X) atom (S, Se, Te). One layer of M atoms is sandwiched between two layers of X atoms. They are the part of the family of 2D materials, a name to emphasize their thickness. The discovery of graphene shows different properties emerge when a bulk crystal of macroscopic dimensions is thinned down to atomic layers. Like graphite, TMD bulk crystals are formed of monolayers bound to each other by Van der Waals attraction. Our research group exploits several interesting properties of TMDC's mentioned 


below to investigate photocatalytic dye degradation, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), supercapacitors and many other physical phenomena


(i) TMD monolayers MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, WSe2, MoTe2 have a direct band gap, and can be used in electronics as transistors and in optics as emitters and detectors.


(ii) The TMD monolayer crystal structure has no inversion center, which allows to access a new degree of freedom of charge carriers, namely the k-valley index, and to open up a new field of physics: valleytronics


(iii) The strong spin-orbit coupling in TMD monolayers leads to a spin-orbit splitting of hundreds meV in the valence band and a few meV in the conduction band, which allows control of the electron spin by tuning the excitation laser photon energy and handedness. The work on TMD monolayers is an emerging research and development field since the discovery of the direct bandgap and the potential applications in electronics and valley physics. TMDs are often combined with other 2D materials like graphene and hexagonal boron nitride to make van der Waals heterostructure. These heterostructures need to be optimized to be possibly used as building blocks for many different devices such as transistors, solar cells, LEDs, photodetectors, fuel cells, photocatalytic and sensing devices. Some of these devices are already used in everyday life and can become smaller, cheaper and more efficient by using TMD monolayers.

                                                                Research Interest                                                    








The research in our group can be broadly classified as 
Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics
. More specifically, our research focuses on the field of 
 Strongly Correlated Electron Systems (Ground State as well as Spectroscopic properties)
, where electron-electron interactions cannot be treated as a perturbation to its motion in the crystal potential, resulting in the breakdown of conventional band-structure description for such systems, at least in the rigourous sense.


On one hand, this field helps us to better understand emergent phenomena that can arise out of strong, non-perturbative interactions between electrons in narrow-band solids, like 
compounds of transition metals, rare-earths and actinides
. The hallmark of this is seen in exotic phenomena like 
colossal magnetoresistance
 in the Manganites, 
high-temperature superconductivity
 in the Cuprates, 
spin-charge separation
 and 
charge fractionalization
 in low-dimensional correlated systems, and the 
Kondo effect
, to name a few. In such phenomena one simply cannot think of each electron independently, but must take into account the collective behaviour of a macroscopically large number (~ Avogadro's Number) of electrons, all acting in unison. On the other hand, a basic understanding of the physics of these materials helps in designing “smart materials” with advanced and energy-efficient functionalities.


Since treating the full correlation problem for an infinite solid is an unsolvable problem, the challenge for theory is to continuously develop newer and more efficient analytical approximations and numerical techniques to better understand the properties of these “quantum materials”, as constantly emerging from experiments. We have been working in this field for more than a decade, trying to model the ground state (low-energy) as well as the spectroscopic (high-energy) properties of correlated electron systems, in collaboration with leading experts in the field, both in India and abroad. 
We are interested both in model problems as well as in complex real materials
. Our research interests and efforts have been traditionally directed towards the following broad areas :




Electronic, Magnetic and Spectral properties of Strongly Correlated Electron Systems : 
Including mixed-valent systems, systems with strong spin-orbit coupling (e.g., 
4d
 and 
5d
 transition metal oxides), systems exhibiting exotic spin-orbital and hidden order.


Modeling of high-energy X-ray spectroscopies : 
e.g. XAS, AES, XPS, NIXS, RIXS etc.
 in strongly correlated systems.


Spin/orbital magnetism and magneto-crystalline anisotropy in nano-structured materials :
 e.g., surfaces/thin-films/multilayers/nano-particles 
etc
.


Development of new computational tools for correlated electron systems.




More recently, we have developed an interest in some newer research areas and are already pursuing active research in some of them (highlighted in blue). These are listed below :




Calculation of High-energy Optical Conductivity in Strongly Correlated Electron Systems (related to my 
successfully completed
 DST Project ECR/2016/002054).


Application of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to Disordered Quantum Electronic and Spin Systems.


Integrability, Ergodicity and Quantum Chaos in Quantum Lattice Models.


Multifractality and Many-body Localization in Disordered Interacting Systems.


Investigation of Astrophysical Magnetism in Compact Astrophysical Objects based on Methods of Quantum Statistics.


Topological Aspects in Condensed Matter Physics.

In 2001, I was selected by the CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research) as one of the CPYLS (CSIR Program in Youth for Leadership in Science) scholars. In 2005, I secured Rank 8 in All India Joint Entrance Screening Test for admission in a PhD / Integrated PhD Programme in Physics, India; and Rank 24 in All India Joint Admission Test for MSc (JAM) for admissions to MSc / MSc-PhD Programmes at the Indian Institutes of Technology, India.

I have completed research mentor training through “Building Mentoring Skills for an Academic Career” workshops, offered by Cornell University in Spring 2019.

I have completed the NyTi peer-to-peer mentoring programme of the University of Stavanger (https://bit.ly/2kAz8Lf) during 2019-2020, which aims to provide teaching-related peer-based support to ensure that new colleagues get off to a good start as university teachers, and that their students receive the best possible teaching as soon as possible. Participation in the programme contributes to qualifying as a university teacher.

I have been appointed as a Nordita Corresponding Fellow in Nordita (Stockholm) from 01-07-2020 to 30-06-2023.

I have won fundings for grant proposals, submitted as part of the

(1) PRELUDIUM BIS-2, 2020; and

Student Outcomes


























































Department of Economics


The Department of Economics at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence is one of the premier Economics departments in India. Established in 2012, it has quickly established its reputation as one of the leading economics education and research centers. It aims to undertake research of the highest quality in Economics which enables and empowers citizens of the society in an ever-changing world and broadens the horizons of the discipline.


The department comprises faculty members with an active research agenda in various sub-disciplines in economics, including economic theory, macroeconomics, development economics, environmental economics, international trade, labor economics, health economics, public economics, political economy, and finance.


The department's spirit is to nurture high-quality, esoteric, and locally relevant research, actively. We pass on the same values to the next generation of economists through our faculty members' rigorous training in mathematical tools, computational skills, and an in-depth understanding of societal functioning.


Our uniquely designed academic program in Economics is both challenging and exciting, balanced between expanding theoretical knowledge and developing hands-on data-handling skills. With that vision, the department has designed its courses to provide all students with the requisite breadth and depth to master the tools of Economics. The faculty consists of active researchers trained at some of the best research universities in the world who bring the most updated knowledge pool and skill set into the classroom.


The training imparted is comparable to internationally acclaimed programs, and students are encouraged to be creative, analytical, and logical thinkers. This way of thinking enables them to offer innovative solutions to the problems they face in their surroundings. Additionally, all courses offered are equally challenging and spread across various disciplines (such as Computer Science, English, Mathematics, and Sociology), providing students with an in-depth interdisciplinary perspective.


The department's undergraduate programs are, a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc. Research) degree in Economics and a B.Sc. (Research) degree in Economics and Finance. The latter is offered in collaboration with the Department of Finance Accounting and Control (School of Management & Entrepreneurship). We offer a minor in economics for those pursuing other degrees but are keen on knowing how the economy functions.


The Department of Economics also offers a Master of Science (M.Sc.) and a doctoral degree (Ph.D.) in economics. Both graduate degrees are designed to expose students to cutting-edge research in economics and equip them with the tools necessary to conduct research in modern economics. The department has been broadly successful in placing its graduates within and outside India, in academia or otherwise.

PhD in International Relations and Governance Studies Announcement






The Department of International Relations and Governance Studies at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence (Deemed to be University), Delhi-NCR invites applications to its PhD programme 2024. Coursework for the incoming batch will commence 
mid-August 2024.


This announcement contains the necessary information related to the programme and the application process. 
Applicants are expected to read this document carefully before making their applications
.




Areas of research


The Department offers wide-ranging expertise within the broad domains of International Relations and Governance. Specific details related to research interests of individual faculty members can be accessed on the Department’s website: 
https://snu.edu.in/schools/school-of-humanities-and-social-sciences/departments/department-of-international-relations-and-governance-studies/


Availability of supervision will be a key criterion for selection. Applicants are therefore advised to carefully peruse faculty research interests from their profile pages as available on the Department website. Excellent candidates with research interests broadly congruent (but not exactly matching) in-house faculty research expertise and interests are also encouraged to apply.


Philosophy


The Doctoral Programme at the Department of International Relations and Governance Studies provides research scholars an excellent opportunity to acquire and consolidate a diverse set of skills. Scholars will get a ringside view of the discipline of International Relations – covering disciplinary history, theory and empirics – as well as of governance and development. They will participate in debates on the philosophy of science/social science while developing a 'nuts and bolts' pragmatism when it comes to operationalizing their doctoral projects.


The threads that run through the PhD programme are, first, an understanding of the significance of context – historical, cultural, economic, among others – when it comes to thinking about the world and, second, a keen awareness of the need to address asymmetries and deeper imbalances of knowledge production, circulation and consumption between the global North and the global South. The objective at the Department is to develop a contextual approach to studying international relations and global governance.


Duration and structure


The PhD programme at the Department spans ten semesters (five years). Doctoral candidates will spend at least the first two semesters on course work, while the remaining time shall be spent on research work and writing of the thesis. Progression from the course work to the thesis writing stage is contingent on performance. Doctoral candidates are expected to reside on campus for at least two years and actively participate in the Department’s activities.


Fees and Assistantship


Detailed information about the fee structure and the nature of assistantships is available on the SNIoE admission’s 
website
.


All full-time Ph.D. students admitted into the program shall receive a 
doctoral award (teaching and research assistantship) consisting of tuition-fee waiver 
(as per department recommendation) and a monthly stipend of 
₹
40,000 for the first two years, and 
₹
45,000 for the next three years, 
subject to benchmarked performance. Continuation of the award is subject to satisfactory performance in the program evaluated continuously and compliance with all University regulations. 
Support will be available for deserving Ph.D. students to disseminate their work through conferences and publications. Students with CSIR, UGC, INSPIRE, ICMR fellowships shall receive 100% tuition fee waiver.
